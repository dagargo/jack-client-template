As with other autotools project, you need to run the following commands.

autoreconf --install
./configure
make
sudo make install

The package dependencies for Debian based distributions are:

    automake
    libusb-1.0-0-dev
    libjack-jackd2-dev
    libsamplerate0-dev

You can easily install them by running "sudo apt install automake libusb-1.0-0-dev libjack-jackd2-dev libsamplerate0-dev".

After installing Overwitch, we could allow it to adjust its own priority to realtime with this command.
